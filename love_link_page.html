    <p>
        As we approach one year together, my heart is full of gratitude. You’ve brought peace into my life,
        happiness into my days, and love into my soul. Being with you has taught me patience, kindness,
        and what it truly means to care for someone deeply 💓.

    <p>
        Every moment with you feels like a gift from Allah, and every memory we’ve made is a treasure
        in my heart 🌹.
    </p>
    <p>
        In shaa Allah, this is only the beginning of a long, beautiful, and blessed journey between us —
        one that leads to a halal and happy future together 🤲💍❤️.
